<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare Your Equipment:
        <ul>
            <li>Place the V60 dripper on top of your coffee server or carafe.</li>
            <li>Put a V60 paper filter in the dripper and rinse it with hot water to remove any paper taste and to preheat the dripper and carafe. Discard the rinse water.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add Ice:
        <ul>
            <li>Place 150 grams of ice cubes into the coffee server or carafe.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Grind the Coffee:
        <ul>
            <li>Grind 20 grams of coffee beans to a medium grind size, similar to sea salt.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add Coffee Grounds:
        <ul>
            <li>Pour the ground coffee into the rinsed filter in the V60 dripper. Gently shake the dripper to level the coffee bed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Pour the Hot Water:
        <ul>
            <li>Start your timer. Begin by pouring a small amount of hot water (about 40 grams) over the coffee grounds to bloom the coffee. This allows the coffee to degas and ensures even extraction.</li>
            <li>Wait for 30 seconds.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Continue Pouring:
        <ul>
            <li>After the bloom, slowly pour the remaining hot water (110 grams) in a circular motion, making sure to saturate all the coffee grounds. Aim to finish pouring by the 2-minute mark.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Let the Coffee Brew:
        <ul>
            <li>Allow the coffee to drip through the filter and onto the ice in the server. The ice will rapidly cool the hot coffee, preserving its flavors and aromas.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Serve and Enjoy:
        <ul>
            <li>Once all the water has passed through the coffee grounds (usually by around 2:30 to 3:00 minutes), remove the dripper.</li>
            <li>Swirl the coffee in the server to mix and cool it evenly.</li>
            <li>Pour the iced coffee into a glass filled with additional ice if desired.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your refreshing iced pour-over coffee!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
